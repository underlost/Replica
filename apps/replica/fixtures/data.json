I've had some time to think it over, and I keep coming to the same conclusion. The Ouya is little more than a smartphone masquerading as a home console. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, it\u2019s just what it is. \r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n\r\nLets start with the hardware. It\u2019s near identical to what\u2019s found in the current generation of smartphones and tablets. Nothing about it is really impressive. It\u2019s CPU, the Terga3, was specifically designed for mobile devices, specifically audio and video. Its a 32-bit multicore ARM architecture with a very small cache. In theory it\u2019s nearly as powerful as a current generation console.The Terga3 however was designed to be very low in power consumption. But since the Ouya is plugged in at all times, it can be pushed harder than a tablet would. How much they\u2019re able to take advantage of this fact and optimize it has yet to be seen. \r\n\r\nWhat really troubles me though, is the small amount of internal disk space the Ouya has. With only 8GB of internal space, even less when you take into consideration of system files, and no dvd drive in sight, any dream that it could compete with an Xbox, Playstation or Wii is killed. Between high resolution textures, audio and cutscenes, 8GB fills up incredibly fast. Unless you\u2019re an indie title, most modern games take up between 5-10GB. With such a restriction you severely limit the size you want games to be on your platform. Even if you\u2019re able to attach an external hard drive, publishers like EA or Activision wouldn\u2019t force such a requirement to play their games. They have never required extra hardware to run their game on a console before and wouldnt start now. \r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most baffling above all, is why it runs Android. If you were serious about \u201cdisrupting\u201d the industry, you don\u2019t half-ass it and choose a mobile OS to power your home entertainment system. You have the freedom to use any variation of Linux you want, and you choose Android? By no means is Android a bad OS. It\u2019s great for tablets and phones, it just hasn\u2019t been proven as viable gaming platform **yet**. And let\u2019s face it, game companies are lazy and greedy. Why would they choose to waste the time to port a full game to another platform, when they can easily make minimal changes to their IOS/Android game? \r\n\r\n### The Zeebo Clone?\r\n\r\nWhat everyone seems to also overlook is the [Zeebo](http://www.giantbomb.com/zeebo/60-122/). A few years ago, Zeebo Inc released an inexpensive console to developing countries. The premise of it was to be an affordable home console system. To keep costs low, it\u2019s architecture was very similar to the Ouya. Unlike the Ouya however, they had agreements with EA and Capcom. And while it has reached moderate success, the only games that ever made it to the console were ports of existing mobile games. I can only hope large publishers will take notice of Ouya\u2019s Kickstarter popularity, and the additional money being raised will go to fund deals with them. \r\n\r\nWhen you look at the big picture, this will be the platform for indie developers and small/casual games. And you know what? I\u2019m perfectly happy with that. I will never see it as a replacement for my Xbox 360, or a Playstation 3, but for $99, its a pretty cheap investment. Not to mention there are mobile-only apps that I would much prefer playing on a big screen instead of a handheld. ",
