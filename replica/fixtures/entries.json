In fact, it was Diablo and battle.net chat that got me into programming. Between the lack of any real security, the open source examples of battle.net chat bots and numerous tutorials, it was a great way to get started programming. \r\n\r\nBy the time I was 15, I grew bored of actually playing the games. I probably spent more time in Visual Studio reverse engineering the bnet protocol than actually playing. We idled in the Diablo public channel \"Bounty Hunters\". We had contests to see who could make our bots do more interesting things. Seeing who could make bots to automaiclly win games in Starcraft, or lose the most in Warcraft (and so ulost bot was born. But thats another story). \r\n\r\nAround this time hackers had started making maphacks that went undetectable by Warden, Blizzard's security in Diablo II. There were exploits to duplicate items. We even made our own corrupted items with absurd abilities. Sure, it made the game easy to play, but that wasnt the point. It wasnt about playing the game. It was about finding new things to do with the game. It was a new challange. To see if it could be done. \r\n\r\nBut like all challenges, it eventually was conquered, and I was bored again. And being the immature teenager I was, I became greedy. I wanted more. Now, at this point in time on the battle.net, keyloggers and viruses were everywhere. It was common to go in a public chat channel, and see all kinds of spam and phishing attcks of people trying to steal your account. While theri were a few uneducated people that fell for it, the majority of battle.net was clever enough to not fall for the \"God mode\" or \"dupe\" hacks that floated around. That is, until I stepped in. \r\n\r\nI decided to take the average phishing attack further. The idea was, What if I actually made a program that did just what all the fakes promised? I started with something simple. A maphack. A simple \"Click here to reveal the map\" button.  And you know what? It actually worked. It was even undetectable by Diablo 2's Security protocol, Warden.  Then I passed it around. Using different usernames, I posted it in chat channels and forums. Pretty much where everyone else spamed.  \r\n\r\nA while before I wrote the maphack, I had discovered a pretty simple \"God Mode\" exe file someone was using to phish for passwords. It was a simple little app written in Visual Basic. It did nothhing more than a simple key logger that connected to a polish smtp server and sent an email with all the keystroked it captured every 5 minutes or so. Using a standard hex editor I was able to find the username/password and smtp server address. Why was this important? \r\n",

Of the 800 or so that saw the link, about 300 actually visited the site. Not bad for such a tacky marketing ploy. About 150 even left their thoughts. \r\n\r\nAfter returning home, I refined the idea, renamed it to a more suitable name, and built a new prototype.
